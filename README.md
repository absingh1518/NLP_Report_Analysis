# NLP_Report_Analysis
A  customized solution that combines keyword extraction and anomaly detection specifically for transaction report health checks

This implementation combines KeyBERT for advanced keyword extraction with anomaly detection capabilities. The system uses multiple keyword extraction methods (KeyBERT and YAKE) to ensure comprehensive coverage of important terms in the reports. The anomaly detection component uses Isolation Forest to identify unusual patterns in transaction data.
The system is specifically designed to:
	•	Extract and categorize keywords related to transactions, errors, and health metrics
	•	Detect anomalies in transaction data using machine learning
	•	Provide a comprehensive health status evaluation
	•	Flag potentially incorrect or anomalous data for review
